# Post-Retrofit
Hello,
I am going to demonstrate how to Post an Api call using retrofit
The dummy Api I am going to us is https://reqres.in/
I have noticed majority materials found on the internet regarding retrofit demonstrate how to use the GET method which is understandable. So after some troubleðŸ˜¥ I finally found a solution thAT ACTUALLY WORKSðŸŽ‰.
Do note I found this geeks for geeks article helpful https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-post-data-to-api-using-retrofit-in-android-using-jetpack-compose/
and I and some adjustments. Please refer to the link to get some more insights.
Feel free to add your sentiments and improve the code.
Please refer to the master branch
